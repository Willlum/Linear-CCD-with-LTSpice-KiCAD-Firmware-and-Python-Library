# Introduction
This repository provides electrical design, firmware and a Python class for a Linear CCD and Microcontroller that features low noise, high precision and high bandwidth with reproducible timing for trigger, gate and sync operations with a rich set of features to support experiments in spectrometry and imaging.  In the following we describe the electrical issues for interfacing a CCD and our solution for this board, and issues related to timing and photometrics with a CCD and our solution in firmware.  Finally we describe the human parseable API and our Python class library and utility for operating the device.

While we use the Toshiba TCD 1340 and Teensy 4.x or 3.x, the principles are general and the design is easily adapted to other linear CCDs and other microcontrollers.
I have made variations of this for several linear CCD's and used it in my own research.   If you would like one of these boards or a board with a different sensor, please contact me.  S
